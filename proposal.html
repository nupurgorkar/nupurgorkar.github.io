      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Project Concept/Motivation: 
        ‘Ugly Christmas Sweaters’ are usually designed cheaply with the intention of only being used once. However, 92 million tonnes of textile waste are produced annually, with fast fashion contributing to 10% of CO2 emissions worldwide. I want to develop an ‘ugly christmas sweater’ with detachable electrical components, making it easier to clean and reuse. With these design decisions, this fun tradition can be made more sustainable and less wasteful. 
        Anticipated Bill of Materials: 
        RGB LED strips (for light display on detachable component)
        Speakers (for audio output)
        Button or remote control (to trigger led and audio component)
        Assorted resistors (for current-limiting)
        Yarn (for sweater)
        Felt (for detachable components)
        Request to use a knitting machine for this project because I think it would be cool and fun!
        Timeline and contingency plans:
        The most important part of this project is the detachable led component fully working with a remote control. Getting the LED display to work is the top priority, and audio is a stretch goal.  
        Get remote control or button system working
        Secondly, I would need the base of the sweater to be done. Hopefully this is something that I can work on before the electrical components need to be added. 
        I want the audio and LED displays to not be dependent on each other. If the LED doesn’t work, the audio should still be able to work, and visa versa.
